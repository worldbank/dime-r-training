# R for Stata users

## Background
This material was developed by the [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics) team as an introduction to R Statistical Package for its staff.

## Course description
R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis. It is a powerful and flexible tool widely used among statisticians and data scientists, and has a growing user base in economics research. This course is designed to familiarize participants with the language, focusing on common tasks and analysis in development research.
The course will build upon comparisons to Stata syntax and requires familiarity with the use of do-files, loops and macros. It also assumes some degree of familiarity with DIME's [coding practices](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Stata_Coding_Practices). All sessions are designed to last 90 minutes.
