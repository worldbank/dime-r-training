# R for Data Analysis

## Background

This material was developed by the [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics) team as an introduction to R.

## Course description

R is a programming language for statistical analysis and data science. It is a powerful and flexible tool widely used among statisticians and data scientists, and has a growing user base in economics research. This course is designed to familiarize participants with the language, focusing on common tasks and analysis in development research, and showing how to use R through RStudio, a popular integrated development environment for R.

The first sessions of the course will build upon comparisons to Stata syntax and requires familiarity with the use of do-files, loops and locals. All sessions are designed to last 90 minutes. Participants need to have R and RStudio installed to follow each session.
