# R for Stata users

## Background
This material was developed by the [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/data-and-analytics) team as an introduction to R Statistical Package for its staff.

## Course description
R is a programming language for statistical analysis and data science. It is a powerful and flexible tool widely used among statisticians and data scientists, and has a growing user base in economics research. This course is designed to familiarize participants with the language, focusing on common tasks and analysis in development research, and showing how to use R through RStudio, a popular integrated development environment for R.
The course will build upon comparisons to Stata syntax and requires familiarity with the use of do-files, loops and macros. It also assumes some degree of familiarity with DIME's [coding practices](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Stata_Coding_Practices). All sessions are designed to last 90 minutes.
