# R Packages

- Installing R in your computer gives you access to its basic functions

- Additionally, you can also install packages. Packages are a collection of R functions that allow you to do:

  + Operations that basic R functions don't do (example: work with geographic data)
  
  + Operations that basic R functions do, but easier (example: data wrangling)
  
- They contain code that other R users have prepared for the community.

---

# R Packages 

In a nutshell:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/r-libraries.png")
```

---

# R Packages

We'll use two packages in today's session: `dplyr` and `readr` (really useful library for data cleaning and wrangling).  

## Exercise 1: Installing R Packages

1. Install the R Packages by using `install.packages()`

 + `install.packages("dplyr")`
 + `install.packages("readr")`
 +  Note the quotes (`" "`) in the packages names
 + **Introduce this code in the console**, not the script panel
 
.pull-left[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/dplyr-install.png")
```
]

---

# R packages 

## Installing packages

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/installing-dplyr.png")
```

---

# R packages

Now that `dplyr` is installed, we only need to load them to start using the functions they have.

## Exercise 2: Loading packages

.pull-left[
1. Open a new script with `File` >> `New File` >> `R Script`

1. Load the packages with: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

  + Run this code from the new script you just opened
  + Notice that we don't use quotes in the package names this time
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/loading-dplyr.png")
```
]

---

# R packages 

- Library installation:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="37%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/installation.png")
```

- Library loading:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="37%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/loading.png")
```

- You install R packages only once in your computer

- You load packages every time you open a new RStudio window (only load the packages you will use)

# Data wrangling 

## Getting your data ready

- Data is rarely in a format where it can be converted in an output right away

- In statistical programming, the process of transforming data into a condition where it's ready to be converted into an output is called **data wrangling**

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/data-wrangling.png")
```

---

# Data wrangling 

## Getting your data ready

- Data wrangling is one of the most crucial and time-consuming aspects of analytics

- It involves not only coding, but also the mental exercise of thinking  what is the shape and condition that your dataframe needs to have in order to produce your desired output

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/data-wrangling-reasoning.png")
```

---

# Data wrangling 

## Getting your data ready

.pull-left[
- As we said before we'll use `dplyr` for data wrangling in this training

- You can also use basic R, but we recommend these packages because its functions are easier to use
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/dplyr.png")
```
]

---

# Data wrangling 

## Exercise 3: Loading data

Note that this part of this is the same exercise we did in session 1, but it's okay to repeat it in order to start using a new RStudio session. **If you have RStudio open, start by closing the window and opening RStudio again**.

.pull-left[
1. Inyou new RStudio window, go to `File` > `Import Dataset` > `From Text(base)` and select again the file `department_staff_list.csv`

  + if you don't know where the file is, check in the `Downloads` folder
  + if you need to download it again, it's here: https://osf.io/chdgj

1. Make sure to select `Heading` > `Yes` in the next window

1. Select `Import`

1. Download this new file `department_staff_age.csv`: https://osf.io/qsmke and repeat steps 1-3  with it

]
.pull-right[

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session1/import3.png")
```
]

---

# Data wrangling 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
department_staff_list <- read.csv("data/department_staff_list.csv")
department_staff_age <- read.csv("data/department_staff_age.csv")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/ex4.png")
```

---

# Data wrangling 

## Note: loading data with a function

- You can also load csv files with the function `read.csv()` instead of using this point-and-click approach

- The **argument** of `read.csv()` is the path in your computer where your data is. For example

```{r, eval=FALSE}
department_staff_list <-read.csv("C:/Users/wb614536/Downloads/department_staff_list.csv")
```

- As usual, you need to save the result of `read.csv()` into a dataframe object with the arrow operator (`<-`) for it to be stored in the environment

---

# Note on file paths 

- A **file path** tells R where to find your file on your computer. It is like giving R the directions to your file.

- If you downloaded the data and haven't moved it, the data path for the deparment_list dataset will be probably something like: `"C:/Users/wb614536/Downloads/department_staff_list.csv"`

- You can find the path of a file by right-clicking>properties>and seeing the location, or by clicking on the top bar (see below)

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/path.png")
```

---

# Data wrangling 

## Recap: knowing your data

- Dataframe `department_staff_list` is the same dataframe we used last session that contains the data from your department. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
glimpse(department_staff_list)
```

---

# Data wrangling 

## Recap: knowing your data

- Now we are introducing a second dataset that only has the ID number (one that I invented), and the age of that person. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
glimpse(department_staff_age)
```

---

# Data wrangling 

- We will only use this second dataframe in one of the next exercises, but we load it now because it's in general a good practice to have data loaded into the memory so it's ready to be used.

- For the next exercises, we will propose scenarios that could show up while doing your annual reports or in day-to-day operations.

- We will do everything using **functions** from the `dplyr` package, that is already in our environment.

# Filtering and sorting

---

# Filtering and sorting 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/filter.png")
```


## Government analytics request

**Scenario 1**: Imagine you want to include in the annual reports, the number of total female employees in the department staff:

‚ùéIn Excel:  The command that we will learn here, is similar to using filter in Excel.

---

# Filtering and sorting 

## Government analytics request

.pull-left[
*We will use the data from our dataframe department_staff_list*
]
.pull-right[
*For this we can filter the Female rows from the sex category*
]

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/filtering-sorting-planning.png")
```

---

# Filtering and sorting 

## Government analytics request

Now let's say that we are also interested at a first glance of the females that recently joined the department. We would have to do the following 

1. Keeping only the female employees
1. Sorting by years of service

‚ùéIn Excel:  We would filter and then use arrange by years of service. 


---

# Filtering and sorting 

## 1. Keeping only the female employees

Use `filter()` for this:

Remember how we use functions in this case 1st argument is **data**, second argument is **filter** (sex takes the value female in this case)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
temp1 <- filter(department_staff_list, sex == "Female")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/filtering-sorting1.png")
```
---

# Filtering and sorting 

## 2. Sorting by years of service

Use the function `arrange()` to sort. Sortings are ascending by default in R (this will get us from less years of service to more years of service). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
department_female <- arrange(temp1, years_of_service)  # arrange by years of service
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/filtering-sorting2.png")
```

---

# Filtering and sorting 

## Exercise 4: Now let's do it.. filter and sort your data

We can write the whole code for this in our exercise script. (You can copy and paste the code below)

1.- Filter by `Female`:

2.- Sort by `years_of_service`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
temp1 <-  filter(department_staff_list, sex == "Female") # filter by female

department_female <- arrange(temp1, years_of_service) # order by years of service
  
```

---

# Filtering and sorting 

Some notes:

.pull-left[
- `filter()` and `arrange()` are all functions from `dplyr`. Remember you have to always load `dplyr` first with `library(dplyr)` to be able to use them
- The resulting dataframe is `department_female` (and we also have `temp1`) 
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/ex5.png")
```
]
---

# Filtering and sorting

- Filtering and sorting are two very common data wrangling operations in statistical programming

- Now we'll review a new data wrangling operation that is also quite common and useful: **mutate**, which basically means creating new variables

---

class: inverse, center, middle
name: mutate

# Mutate

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#D38C28' size=1px width=1100px></html>

---

# Mutate

- `mutate` will take a statement like this:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
mutate(variable_name = some_calculation)
```

- And attach variable_name at the end of the dataset.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="45%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/mutate.png")
```

---

# Mutate

## Example

Using our data frame let's say that we want to include a variable that instead of years of service we want days of service. We would do this by doing the following: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
example_mutate <-  mutate(department_staff_list, days_of_service = years_of_service*365)
```

We will not use that variable for our government analytics examples, but this is a really useful data wrangling function.

name: merging

# Merging dataframes

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#D38C28' size=1px width=1100px></html>

---


# Merging dataframes

Merging data is a common task in data analysis, especially when working with data from multiple departments. 

Let's see how it would apply to our dataframes.

## Government analytics request

**Scenario 2:**

*Let's imagine that for our annual report we are also interested in the age distribution from the employees* but these are in different datasets

---

# Merging dataframes

## Government analytics request

.pull-left[
*Use the data `department_staff_list` that you already know with the department_staff_age*
]
.pull-right[
*We want to include the `age` variable to our dataframe*
]

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/merging-planning.png")
```

---

# Merging dataframes

To do this we will use `left_join()` to merge the dataframes:

- The arguments of the function are 1. the "principal" dataset and 2. the dataframe we want to merge (paste) into that one

```{r eval=FALSE}
department_age <- left_join(department_staff_list, department_staff_age) # Our original data frame 
```


```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/merging.png")
```

---

# Merging dataframes

## Exercise 5: Now let's do it. 

- You can copy and paste the code to your exercise script. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
deparment_age <- left_join(deparment_staff_list, department_staff_age) # Our original data frame
```
```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/exercise6.png")
```
---

# group_by() and summarize()

We use this when we want to aggregate your data (by groups).

This is one of the most commons operations. Sometimes we want to calculate statistics by groups 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="55%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/group_by.png")
```

---

# Grouping and summarizing 

## Government analytics request

**Let's say that we are interested again in the number of employees by department**

We will use our department_staff_list dataset to do this. 

1. The first step is to define the group, in this case `department`

```{r, eval=FALSE}

employees_by_deparment <- group_by(department_staff_list, department)
  

```

If we **only** do this, this won't do anything, to complete the function we need to use this with `summarise()`

---

# Grouping and summarizing 

## Exercise 6: Government analytics request

summarize works in a similar way to mutate:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
variable_name = some_calculation
```

In this case the `some_calculation` will be to count the number of employees

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
temp1 <- group_by(department_staff_list, department)
employees_by_department <- summarise(temp1, number = n())

```

---
# Grouping and summarizing 

## Government analytics request

This will create the following dataframe/table:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
employees_by_department
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
write.csv(employees_by_department, "data/employees_by_department.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

---

# More wrangling operations

These were two examples we chose to show different possible data wrangling operations. A summary of these and other common operations are:

| Operation | Function in `dplyr` |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Subset columns | `select()`|
| Subset rows (based on condition) | `filter()` |
| Create new columns | `mutate()` |
| Create new columns based on condition | `mutate()` and `case_when()` |
| Create new rows | `add_row()` |
| Merge dataframes | `inner_join()`, `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `full_join()` |
| Append dataframes | `bind_rows()` |
| Deduplicate | `distinct()` |
| Collapse and create summary indicators | `group_by()`, `summarize()` |
| Pass a result as the first argument for the next function | `%>%` (operator, not function (**tomorrow**))|

name: exporting-outputs

# Exporting outputs 

<html><div style='float:left'></div><hr color='#D38C28' size=1px width=1100px></html>

---

# Exporting outputs 

- Until now, we've seen full examples of part 1 and 2 of the Government analytics pipeline
- What about exporting outputs?

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/data-work-progress.png")
```

- We'll see this in the next exercise

---

# Exporting outputs 

## Exporting dataframes

- We can export it as a csv file with the function `write.csv()`

- `write.csv()` creates a csv file with the dataframe

- It takes two basic arguments:

  1. The name of the object you want to export
  1. A file path to export the object to

---

# Exporting outputs 

## Exercise 7 (if time allows): Export `employees_by_deparment` and `department_staff_final`

1. Use this code to export the results of the last two exercises:

```{r eval=FALSE}
write.csv(employees_by_deparment, "employees_by_deparment", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(department_age, "department_staff_final", row.names = FALSE)
```

Note: This files are already in our data folder online, so if you don't have time to do it don't worry. 

---

# Exporting outputs 

Now `employees_by_deparment.csv` (probably in your `Documents` folder).

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/session2/exported-csv.png")
```

---

# Exporting outputs 

## Some notes on file paths

- The second argument of `write.csv()` specifies the file path we export the dataframe to

```{r eval=FALSE}
write.csv(employees_by_deparment, "employees_by_deparment", row.names = FALSE)
```

- You can include any path in your computer and R will write the file in that location

  + For example: `"C:/Users/wb614536/OneDrive - WBG/Desktop`" exports the file to the desktop of my computer (this will not work in other computers)
  
  + Note that file paths in R use forward slashes (`/`). Back slashes (`\`) **do not work in R**

---

# Exporting outputs 

Our data pipeline has been fully implemented at this point. Great!

# Appendix 

## Keeping only relevant columns

Imaging I only want a list with ID and department. 

Use `select()` for this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
temp1 <-  select(department_staff_list, ID, department)
```

---

# Appendix 
## Calculating aggregated columns: total and average income

Use `summarize()` combined with `sum()` and `mean()`:

For our current data this does not apply, but this will be really useful for budget dataframes.

This would look something like this

```{r eval=FALSE}
budget_2024 <-  group_by(budget_data, year, product)

budget_2024 <- summarise(budget_2024, 
                         total = sum(income),
                         average = mean(income))
```
