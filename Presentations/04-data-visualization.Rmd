### Initial Setup

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[If You Attended Session 2]
1. Go to the `dime-r-training-main` folder that you created yesterday, and open the `dime-r-training-main` R project that you created there.
]

.panel[.panel-name[If You Did Not Attend Session 2]
1. Copy/paste the following code into a new RStudio script, **replacing "YOURFOLDERPATHHERE" with the folder within which you'll place this R project:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_course(
    url = "https://github.com/worldbank/dime-r-training/archive/main.zip",
    destdir = "YOURFOLDERPATHHERE"
)
```

2. In the console, type in the requisite number to delete the .zip file (we don't need it anymore).

3. A new RStudio environment will open. Use this for the session today.

# Introduction

### Before we start

* Make sure the packages `ggplot2` are installed and loaded. You can load it directly using `library(tidyverse)` or `library(ggplot2)`
* Load the `whr_panel` data set (remember to use the `here` package) we created last week.

```{r, warnings = F}
# Packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

whr_panel <- read_csv(
  here(
    "DataWork", "DataSets", "Final", "whr_panel.csv"
  )
)
```


---

# Introduction

In our workflow there are usually two distinct uses for plots:

1. **Exploratory analysis**: Quickly visualize your data in an insightful way.
  * Base R can be used to quickly create basic figures
  * We will also use `ggplot2` to quickly create basic figures as well.

2. **Publication/Reporting**: Make pretty graphs for a presentation, a project report, or papers:
  * We’ll do this using `ggplot2` with more customization. The idea is to create beautiful graphs.

# Plot with Base R

First, we’re going to use base plot, i.e., using Base R default libraries. It is easy to use and can produce useful graphs with very few lines of code.

.exercise[**Exercise 1:** Exploratory Analysis. 

**(1)** Create a vector called `vars` with the strings: `"economy_gdp_per_capita"`, `"happiness_score"`, `"health_life_expectancy"`, and `"freedom"`. <br>
**(2)** Select all the variables from the vector `vars` in the `whr_panel` dataset and assign to the object `whr_plot`. Hint: use `select(all_of(vars))` for this. <br>
**(3)** Use the `plot()` function: `plot(whr_plot)`

]

`r countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 0, left = 0, font_size = "2em")`

--

```{r}
# Vector of variables
vars <- c("economy_gdp_per_capita", "happiness_score", "health_life_expectancy", "freedom")
# Create a subset with only those variables, let's call this subset whr_plot
whr_plot <- whr_panel %>%
  select(all_of(vars))

```

---

# Base Plot

```{r, out.width = "70%"}
plot(whr_plot)
```

---

# The beauty of ggplot2

.large[

1. Consistency with the [**Grammar of Graphics**](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447)
  * This book is the foundation of several data viz applications: `ggplot2`, `polaris-tableau`, `vega-lite`
2. Flexibility
3. Layering and theme customization
4. Community

It is a powerful and easy to use tool (once you understand its logic) that produces complex and multifaceted plots.

# ggplot2: basic structure (template)

.large[The basic ggplot structure is:]

```{r ggplot-template, echo=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
decorate('
ggplot(data = DATA) +
  GEOM_FUNCTION(mapping = aes(AESTHETIC MAPPINGS))
', eval = FALSE) %>% 
  flair("DATA", background = "#CBB5FF", before = "<b>", after = "</b>") %>% 
  flair("GEOM_FUNCTION", background = "#FFDFD1", before = "<b>", after = "</b>") %>% 
  flair("AESTHETIC MAPPINGS", background = "#FFD0CF", before = "<b>", after = "</b>")
```

1. `Data`: The data that you want to visualize
2. `Layers`: geom\_ and stat\_ → The geometric shapes and statistical summaries representing the data
3. `Aesthetics`: aes() → Aesthetic mappings of the geometric and statistical objects
4. `Scales`: scale_ → Maps between the data and the aesthetic dimensions
5. `Coordinate system`: coord_ → Maps data into the plane of the data rectangle
6. `Facets`: facet_ → The arrangement of the data into a grid of plots
7. `Visual themes`: theme() and theme_ → The overall visual defaults of a plot

# Exploratory Analysis

#### Let's start making some plots.


```{r, out.width = "65%"}
ggplot(data = whr_panel) +    #<<
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = happiness_score, y = economy_gdp_per_capita))
```

---

# Exploratory Analysis

#### We can also set up our mapping in the `ggplot()` function.

```{r, out.width = "65%"}
ggplot(data = whr_panel, aes(x = happiness_score, y = economy_gdp_per_capita)) +   #<<
  geom_point()
```

---

# Exploratory Analysis

#### We can also set up the data outside the `ggplot()` function as follows:

```{r, out.width = "65%"}
whr_panel %>%  #<<
  ggplot(aes(x = happiness_score, y = economy_gdp_per_capita)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

# Exploratory Analysis

.large[I prefer to use the second way of structuring our ggplot.

1. First, setting our data;
2. pipe it;
3. then aesthetics;
4. and finally the geometries.

Both structures will work but this will make a difference if you want to load more datasets at the same time, and whether you would like to combine more geoms in the same ggplot. More on this in the following slides.

]

---

# Exploratory Analysis

.exercise[
**Exercise 2:** Create a scatter plot with `x = freedom` and `y = economy_gdp_per_capita`.
]

`r countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 0, left = 0, font_size = "2em")`

--

.solution[

**Solution:**

```{r, out.width = "45%"}
whr_panel %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = freedom, y = economy_gdp_per_capita))
```

]

---

# Exploratory Analysis

.large[

The most common `geoms` are:


* `geom_bar()`, `geom_col()`: bar charts.
* `geom_boxplot()`: box and whiskers plots.
* `geom_density()`: density estimates.
* `geom_jitter()`: jittered points.
* `geom_line()`: line plots.
* `geom_point()`: scatter plots.

# Exploratory Analysis

Let's try to do something different, try, instead of `region`, adding `color = "blue"` inside `aes()`.

* What do you think is the problem with this code?

.pull-left[

```{r, eval = FALSE}
whr_panel %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = happiness_score,
      y = economy_gdp_per_capita,
      color = "blue"  #<<
    )

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(

    color = "blue"  #<<
  )
) + 
  geom_point()
```

]

---

# Exploratory Analysis

In `ggplot2`, these settings are called **aesthetics**.

> "Aesthetics of the geometric and statistical objects".

We can set up:

* `position`:  x, y, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, etc.
* `colors`: color and fill.
* `transparency`: alpha.
* `sizes`: size and width.
* `shapes`: shape and linetype.


Notice that it is important to know where we are setting our aesthetics. For example:

* `geom_point(aes(color = region))` to color points based on the variable `region`
* `geom_point(color = "red")` to color all points in the same color.

# Exploratory Analysis

Let's modify our last plot. Let's add `color = "blue"` inside `geom_point()`.

# ggplot2: Themes

The `theme()` function allows you to modify each aspect of your plot. Some arguments are:

```{r eval = FALSE}
theme(
    # Title and text labels
    plot.title = element_text(color, size, face),
    # Title font color size and face
    legend.title = element_text(color, size, face),
    # Title alignment. Number from 0 (left) to 1 (right)
    legend.title.align = NULL,
    # Text label font color size and face
    legend.text = element_text(color, size, face),
    # Text label alignment. Number from 0 (left) to 1 (right)
    legend.text.align = NULL,
)
```

More about these modification can be found [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.html)

# ggplot2: Color palettes

.large[

We can also add color palettes using other packages such as: `RColorBrewer, viridis` or funny ones like the `wesanderson` package. So, let's add new colors.

* First, install the `RColorBrewer` package.

]

```{r}
# install.packages("RColorBrewer")
library(RColorBrewer)
```

.large[

* Let's add `scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")` to our ggplot.

# Saving a plot

Remember that in R we can always assign our functions to an object. In this case, we can assign our `ggplot2` code to an object called fig as follows.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
fig <- whr_panel %>%
  filter(
      !is.na(latam) # Make sure that we don't include missing values in our graph
  ) %>%
  filter(year == 2015) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = happiness_score, y = economy_gdp_per_capita,
             color = latam)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
  labs(
    x = "Happiness Score",
    y = "GDP per Capita",
    color = "Country in Latin America\nand the Caribbean",
    title = "Happiness Score vs GDP per Capita, 2015"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Therefore, if you want to plot it again, you can just type `fig` in the console.

# Saving a plot

.exercise[**Exercise 5**: Save a ggplot under the name `fig_*YOUR INITIALS*`. Use the `ggsave()` function. You can either include the function after your plot or, save the ggplot first as an object and then save the plot.

The syntax is `ggsave(OBJECT, filename = FILEPATH, heigth = ..., width = ..., dpi = ...)`.

]

`r countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 0, left = 0, font_size = "2em")`

.notes[

**Solution**:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
fig <- whr_panel %>%
  filter(
      !is.na(latam) # Make sure that we don't include missing values in our graph
  ) %>%
  filter(year == 2015) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = happiness_score, y = economy_gdp_per_capita,
             color = latam)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_discrete(labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
  labs(
    x = "Happiness Score",
    y = "GDP per Capita",
    color = "Country in Latin America\nand the Caribbean",
    title = "Happiness Score vs GDP per Capita, 2015"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ggsave(
  fig,
  filename = here("DataWork","Output","Raw","fig_MA.png"),
  dpi = 750, 
  scale = 0.8,
  height = 8, 
  width = 12
)
```

# Interactive graphs

There are several packages to create interactive or dynamic data vizualizations with R. Here are a few:

* `leaflet` - R integration tp one of the most popular open-source libraries for interactive maps.
* `highcharter` - cool interactive graphs.
* `plotly` - interactive graphs with integration to ggplot.
* `gganimate` - ggplot GIFs.
* `DT` - Interactive table

These are generally, html widgets that can be incorporated in to an html document and websites.

# Interactive graphs

Now we’ll use the ggplotly() function from the plotly package to create an interactive graph!

### Extra exercise: Interactive graphs.

* Load the plotly package
* Pass that object with the last plot you created to the ggplotly() function
