# Overview of GIS conceps

__Spatial data:__ The two main types of spatial data are __vector data__ and __raster data__

.pull-left[
__Vector data__
* Points, lines, or polygons
* Common file formats include shapefiles (.shp) and geojsons (.geojson)
* Examples: polygons on countries, polylines of roads, points of schools
]

.pull-right[
__Raster data__
* Spatially referenced grid
* Common file format is a geotif (.tif)
* Example: Satellite imagery of nighttime lights

# Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

* Coordinate reference systems use pairs of numbers to define a location on the earth
* For example, the World Bank is at a latitude of 38.89 and a longitude of -77.04

# Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)

There are many different coordinate reference systems, which can be grouped into __geographic__ and __projected__ coordinate reference systems. Geographic systems live on a sphere, while projected systems are “projected” onto a flat surface.

# Geographic Coordinate Systems

.pull-left[
__Units:__ Defined by latitude and longitude, which measure angles and units are typically in decimal degrees. (Eg, angle is latitude from the equator).

__Latitude & Longitude:__ 
* On a grid X = longitude, Y = latitude; sometimes represented as (longitude, latitude). 
* Also has become convention to report them in alphabetical order: (latitude, longitude) — such as in Google Maps.
* Valid range of latitude: -90 to 90
* Valid range of longitude: -180 to 180
* __{Tip}__ Latitude sounds (and looks!) like latter.

# Geographic Coordinate Systems

.pull-left[
__Distance on a sphere__

* At the equator (latitude = 0), a 1 decimal degree longitude distance is about 111km; towards the poles (latitude = -90 or 90), a 1 decimal degree longitude distance converges to 0 km. 
* We must be careful (ie, use algorithms that account for a spherical earth) to calculate distances! The distance along a sphere is referred to as a [great circle distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance).
* Multiple options for spherical distance calculations, with trade-off between accuracy & complexity. (See distance section for details).

__Datums__
* __Is the earth flat?__ No!
* __Is the earth a sphere?__ No!
* __Is the earth a lumpy ellipsoid?__ [Yes!](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/earth-round.html#:~:text=The%20Earth%20is%20an%20irregularly%20shaped%20ellipsoid.&text=While%20the%20Earth%20appears%20to,unique%20and%20ever%2Dchanging%20shape.)

The earth is a lumpy ellipsoid, a bit flattened at the poles. 
* A [datum](https://www.maptoaster.com/maptoaster-topo-nz/articles/projection/datum-projection.html) is a model of the earth that is used in mapping. One of the most common datums is [WGS 84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System), which is used by the Global Positional System (GPS). 
* A datum is a reference ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the earth.
* Other datums exist, and the latitude and longitude values for a specific location will be different depending on the datum.

# Projected Coordinate Systems

.pull-left[
Projected coordinate systems project spatial data from a 3D to 2D surface.

__Distortions:__ Projections will distort some combination of distance, area, shape or direction. Different projections can minimize distorting some aspect at the expense of others. 

__Units:__ When projected, points are represented as “northings” and “eastings.” Values are often represented in meters, where northings/eastings are the meter distance from some reference point. Consequently, values can be very large!

__Datums still relevant:__ Projections start from some representation of the earth. Many projections (eg, [UTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system)) use the WGS84 datum as a starting point (ie, reference datum), then project it onto a flat surface.

# Referencing coordinate reference systems

.large[
* There are many ways to reference coordinate systems, some of which are verbose. 
* __PROJ__ (Library for projections) way of referencing WGS84 `+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +type=crs`
* __[EPSG](https://epsg.io/)__ Assigns numeric code to CRSs to make it easier to reference. Here, WGS84 is `4326`. 
]

# Coordinate Reference Systems

Whenever have spatial data, need to know which coordinate reference system (CRS) the data is in.

* You wouldn’t say __“I am 5 away”__
* You would say __“I am 5 [miles / kilometers / minutes / hours] away”__ (units!)
* Similarly, a “complete” way to describe location would be: I am at __6.51 latitude, 3.52 longitude using the WGS 84 CRS__

# Introduction

- This session could be a whole course on its own, but we only have an hour and half.
- To narrow our subject, we will focus on only one type of spatial data, vector data.
- This is the most common type of spatial data that non-GIS experts will encounter in their work.
- We will use the `sf` package, which is the tidyverse-compatible package for geospatial data in R.
- For visualizing, we'll rely on `ggplot2` for static maps and `leaflet` for interactive maps

---

# Setup

1. Copy/paste the following code into a new RStudio script, __replacing "YOURFOLDERPATHHERE" with the folder within which you'll place this R project__:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_course(
  url = "https://github.com/worldbank/dime-r-training/archive/main.zip",
  destdir = "YOURFOLDERPATHHERE"
)
```

2\. In the console, type in the requisite number to delete the .zip file (we don't need it anymore).

3\. A new RStudio environment will open. Use this for the session today.

---

# Setup

Install new packages
```{r, eval = F}
install.packages(c("sf",
                   "leaflet",
                   "geosphere"),
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```


And load them
```{r, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)        # Simple features
library(leaflet)   # Interactive map
library(geosphere) # Great circle distances
```


---

# Load and explore polylines, polylines, and points

The main package we'll rely on is the `sf` (simple features) package. With `sf`, spatial data is structured similarly to a __dataframe__; however, each row is associated with a __geometry__. Geometries can be one of the below types.

.center[
<img src="img/geom_types.png"  width = 400>
]

---

# Load and explore polygon

The first thing we will do in this session is to recreate this data set:

```{r}
nga_sf <- 
  st_read(here("DataWork",
               "DataSets",
               "Final",
               "gadm_nga_2.geojson"))
```

---

# Exploring the data

Look at first few observations

```{r, eval = T}
head(nga_sf)
```

---

# Exploring the data

Number of rows

```{r, eval = T}
nrow(nga_sf)
```

---

# Exploring the data

Check coordinate reference system

```{r, eval = T}
st_crs(nga_sf)
```

---

# Exploring the data

Plot the data. To plot using `ggplot2`, we use the `geom_sf` geometry.

```{r, eval = T, out.width = "60%"}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nga_sf)
```

---

# Attributes of data

We want the area of each location, but we don't have a variable for area

```{r, eval = T}
names(nga_sf)
```

---

# Attributes of data

Determine area. Note the CRS is spherical (WGS84), but `st_area` gives area in meters squared. R uses s2 geomety for this.

```{r, eval = T}
st_area(nga_sf) 
```

---

# Operations similar to dataframes

Create new dataset that is just lagos

```{r, eval = T}
lagos_sf <- nga_sf %>% 
  filter(NAME_1 == "Lagos")
```

---

# Operations similar to dataframes

Plot the dataframe

```{r, eval = T, out.width = "65%"}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lagos_sf)
```

---

# Load and explore polyline

.exercise[

**Exercise:** 
* Load the roads data `osm_lagos_roads.geojson` and name the object `roads_sf`
* Look at the first few observations
* Check the coordinate reference system
* Map the polyline
]

`r countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 0, left = 0, font_size = "2em")`

--

.solution[
**Solution**: 
```{r, eval = F}
roads_sf <- st_read(here("DataWork", "DataSets", "Final", "osm_lagos_roads.geojson"))

head(roads_sf)

st_crs(roads_sf)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = roads_sf)
```
]

---

# Load and explore polyline

```{r}
roads_sf <- 
  st_read(here("DataWork",
               "DataSets",
               "Final",
               "osm_lagos_roads.geojson"))

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = roads_sf)
```

---

# Load and explore polyline

.exercise[

**Exercise:** Determine length of each line (hint: use `st_length`)

]

`r countdown(minutes = 1, seconds = 0, left = 0, font_size = "2em")`

--

.solution[
**Solution**: 
```{r}
st_length(roads_sf)
```
]

---

# Load and explore point data

We'll load a dataset of the location of schools in Lagos

```{r}
schools_df <- 
  read_csv(here("DataWork",
                "DataSets",
                "Final",
                "osm_lagos_schools.csv"))
```

---

# Explore data

```{r}
head(schools_df)
```

---

# Explore data

```{r}
names(schools_df)
```

---

# Convert to spatial object

We define the (1) coordinates (longitude and latitude) and (2) CRS. __Note:__ We must determine the CRS from the data metadata. This dataset comes from OpenStreetMaps, which uses WGS:4326.

__Assigning the incorrect CRS is one of the most common sources of issues I see with geospatial work. If something looks weird, check the CRS!__ 

```{r}
schools_sf <- st_as_sf(schools_df, 
                       coords = c("longitude", "latitude"),
                       crs = 4326)
```

---

# Convert to spatial object

```{r}
head(schools_sf$geometry)
```

---

# Map points object: Using sf

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = schools_sf)
```

---

# Map points object: Using dataframe

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = schools_df,
             aes(x = longitude,
                 y = latitude))
```

---

# Map points objects

.exercise[

**Question:** Why do the maps look different? Map using `sf` looks a bit squished!

]

`r countdown(minutes = 0, seconds = 30, left = 0, font_size = "2em")`

--

.solution[
**Solution**: 

* Units are in decimal degrees. 
* The length (eg, meters) between degrees of longitude shrinks as we go towards the equator. 
* `geom_point` thinks 1 degree distance is the same for latitudes and longitudes (dumb!). 
* `geom_sf` knows that we are in `WGS:4326` (spherical CRS), and adjusts map to minimize distortions (smart!). 
]

# Make better static map

Lets make a better static map.

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
# Adding a variable with squared km
lagos_sf <- lagos_sf %>%
  mutate(area_m = lagos_sf %>% st_area() %>% as.numeric(),
         area_km = area_m / 1000^2)

# Plotting
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lagos_sf,
          aes(fill = area_km)) +
  labs(fill = "Area") +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Blues") + 
  theme_void()
```

---

# Make better static map

Lets add another spatial layer

```{r, out.width = "40%"}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lagos_sf,
          aes(fill = area_km)) +
  geom_sf(data = schools_sf,
          aes(color = "Schools")) +
  labs(fill = "Area",
       color = NULL) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Blues") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = "black") +
  theme_void()
```

---

# Interactive map

We use the `leaflet` package to make interactive maps. Leaflet is a JavaScript library, but the `leaflet` R package allows making interactive maps using R. Use of leaflet somewhat mimics how we use ggplot.

* Start with `leaflet()` (instead of `ggplot()`)
* Add spatial layers, defining type of layer (similar to geometries)


```{r l1, out.height = "40%", out.width = "50%"}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() # Basemap
```

```

---

# Interactive map

Add a pop-up

```{r l3, out.height = "40%", out.width = "50%"}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(data = lagos_sf,
              popup = ~NAME_2) 
```

---

# Interactive map

Add more than one layer

```{r l4, out.height = "40%", out.width = "50%"}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolygons(data = lagos_sf,
              popup = ~NAME_2) %>%
  addCircles(data = schools_sf,
             popup = ~name,
             color = "black")
```

---

# Interactive map of roads

.exercise[

**Exercise:** Create a leaflet map with roads, using the `roads_sf` dataset. (__Hint:__ Use `addPolylines()`)

]

`r countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 0, left = 0, font_size = "2em")`

--

.solution[

**Solution**: 
```{r, eval = F}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%

]

---

# Interactive map of roads

```{r l5, out.height = "40%", out.width = "50%"}
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addPolylines(data = roads_sf)
```

---

# Interactive maps

We can spent lots of time going over what we can done with leaflet - but that would take up too much time. [This resource](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/articles/colors.html) provides helpful tutorials for things like:
* Changing the basemap 
* Adding colors
* Adding a legend
* And much more!

# Spatial operations applied on single dataset

* `st_transform`: Transform CRS
* `st_buffer`: Buffer point/line/polygon
* `st_combine`: Dissolve by attribute
* `st_convex_hull `: Create convex hull
* `st_centroid`: Create new sf object that uses the centroid
* `st_drop_geometry`: Drop geometry; convert from sf to dataframe
* `st_coordinates`: Get matrix of coordinates
* `st_bbox`: Get bounding box

---

# Transform CRS

We want to compute the length of roads in Lagos using the roads dataset. The roads dataset is currently in a geographic CRS (WGS84), where the units are in decimal degrees. We'll tranform the CRS to a projected CRS that is suitable for Nigeria ([EPSG:32632](https://epsg.io/32632)), and where the units will be in meters.

__Note that coordinate values are large!__ Values are large because units are in meters. Large coordinate values suggest projected CRS; latitude is between -90 and 90 and longitude is between -180 and 180.

```{r}
schools_utm_sf <- st_transform(schools_sf, 32632)

schools_utm_sf$geometry %>% head(2) %>% print()
```

---

# Buffer

We have the points of schools. Now we create a 1km buffer around schools.

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
schools_1km_sf <- schools_sf %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 1000) # Units are in meters. Thanks s2!

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = schools_1km_sf)
```

---

# Dissolve by an attribute

Below we have the second administrative regions of Nigeria. Using this dataset, let's create a new object at the first administrative region level.

```{r, out.width = "30%"}
nga1_sf <- nga_sf %>%
  group_by(NAME_1) %>%
  summarise(geometry = st_combine(geometry)) %>%
  ungroup()

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nga1_sf)
```

---

# Convex Hull

__Simple definition:__ Get the outer-most coordinates of a shape and connect-the-dots.

__Formal definition:__ A convex hull of a shape the smallest "convex set" that contains it. (A [convex set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set) is where a straight line can be drawn anywhere in the space and the space fully contains the line).

# Convex hull

In the below example, we create a conex hull around schools; creating a polygon that includes all schools.

__Incorrect attempt__

```{r}
schools_chull1_sf <- schools_sf %>%
  st_convex_hull()

nrow(schools_chull1_sf)
```

---

# Convex hull

__Correct__

```{r, out.width = "40%"}
schools_chull2_sf <- schools_sf %>%
  summarise(geometry = st_combine(geometry)) %>%
  st_convex_hull()

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = schools_chull2_sf) +
  geom_sf(data = schools_sf, color = "red")
```

---

# Determine centroid

Sometimes we want to represent a polygon or polyline as a single point. For this, we can compute the centroid (ie, geographic center) of a polygon/polyline.

Determine centroid of Nigeria ADM2s

```{r, out.width = "40%"}
nga_c_sf <- st_centroid(nga_sf)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = nga_c_sf)
```

---

# Remove geometry

__Incorrect approach__

```{r}
lagos_sf %>% 
  select(-geometry) %>%
  head()
```

---

# Remove geometry

__Correct__

```{r}
lagos_sf %>% 
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  head()
```

---

# Grab coordinates

Create a matrix of coordinates

```{r}
schools_sf %>% 
  st_coordinates() %>%
  head()
```

---

# Get bounding box

```{r}
schools_sf %>% 
  st_bbox() 
```

---

# Exercise

.exercise[

**Exercise:** Create a polyline of all trunk roads in Lagos, and buffer the poyline by 10 meters. In `roads_sf`, the `highway` variable notes road types.

]

`r countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 0, left = 0, font_size = "2em")`

--

.solution[

**Solution**: 
```{r}
roads_sf %>%
  filter(highway == "trunk") %>%
  summarise(geometry = st_combine(geometry)) %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 10)
```

]

---

# Spatial operations using multiple datasets

* `st_distance`: Calculate distances.
* `st_intersects`: Indicates whether simple features intersect.
* `st_intersection`: Cut one spatial object based on another.
* `st_difference`: Remove part of spatial object based on another.  
* `st_join`: Spatial join (ie, add attributes of one dataframe to another based on location). 

---

# Distances

For this example, we'll compute the distance between each school to a motorway.

```{r}
motor_sf <- roads_sf %>%
  filter(highway == "motorway")

# Matrix: distance of each school to each motorway
dist_mat <- st_distance(schools_sf, motor_sf)

# Take minimun distance for each school
dist_mat %>% apply(1, min) %>% head()
```

---

# Distances

There are multiple ways to calculate distances!

* __Great circle:__ sf, by default, uses s2 to computer distance (in meters) when data has a geographic CRS
* __Great circle:__ Other formulas beyond s2, such as Haversine, Vincenty, and Karney’s method. See the [geosphere](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geosphere/geosphere.pdf) and [geodist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geodist/geodist.pdf) packages. Vincenty is more precise than Haversine, and Karney's method is more precise than Vincenty's method. Greater precision comes with heavy computation. For more information, see [here](https://rspatial.org/raster/sphere/2-distance.html).
* __Projected:__ We can use a projected CRS, where units are in meters already.

# Karney’s method 
distGeo(p1 = schools_sf[1,] %>% st_coordinates,

# Intersects

For this example we'll determine which of Lagos's second administrative divisions intersects with a motorway.

```{r}
# Sparse matrix
st_intersects(lagos_sf, motor_sf) %>% print()
```

---

# Intersects

Take `max` (`FALSE` corresponds to 0 and `TRUE` corresponds to 1). So taking max will yeild if unit intersects with _any_ motorway

# Intersection

We have roads for all of Lagos. Here, we want to create new roads object that __only includes__ roads in the Eti-Osa unit.

```{r, out.width = "40%"}
etis_sf <- lagos_sf %>%
  filter(NAME_2 == "Eti-Osa")

roads_etis_sf <- st_intersection(roads_sf, etis_sf)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = roads_etis_sf)
```

---

# Difference

We have roads for all of Lagos. Here, we want to create new roads object that __excludes__ roads in the Eti-Osa unit.

```{r, out.width = "40%"}
roads_notetis_sf <- st_difference(roads_sf, etis_sf)

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = etis_sf, fill = NA, color = "red") +
  geom_sf(data = roads_notetis_sf) 
```

# Spatial join

We have a dataset of schools. The school dataframe contains information such as the school name, but not on the administrative region it's in. To add data on the administrative region that the school is in, we'll perform a spatial join.

Check the variable names. No names of second administrative divison :(
```{r}
names(schools_sf)
```

---

# Spatial join

Use `st_join` to add attributes from `lagos_sf` to `schools_sf`. `st_join` is similar to other join methods (eg, `left_join`); instead of joining on a varible, we join based on location.

```{r}
schools_lagos_sf <- st_join(schools_sf, lagos_sf)

schools_lagos_sf %>% 
  names() %>% 
  print() %>%
  tail(10)
```

# Spatial join

.exercise[

**Exercise:** Make a static map using of Lagos administrative areas, where each administrative area polygon displays the number of schools.

]

.solution[
**Solution**: 
```{r}
## Dataframe of number of schools per NAME_2
n_school_df <- schools_lagos_sf %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  group_by(NAME_2) %>%
  summarise(n_school = n()) %>%
  ungroup()

## Merge info with lagos_sf
lagos_sch_sf <- lagos_sf %>% left_join(n_school_df, by = "NAME_2")

## Map
p <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lagos_sch_sf,
          aes(fill = n_school))
```

]

---

# Spatial join

```{r, out.width = "65%"}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = lagos_sch_sf,
          aes(fill = n_school)) +
  labs(fill = "N\nSchools") +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "YlOrRd") +
  theme_void()
```
